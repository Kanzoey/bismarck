---

Contribution to this project is very serious, although this is more of a hobby project. So after the scary legal jargon, let us get to the specifics of contribution.

Please finely search the issues tab for any duplications your issue, then only open a new issue after you believe it is unique amongst all the previously opened ones. This is to reduce the workload the repository contributors have to go through to search for bug fixes and security updates.

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, [How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-contribute-to-an-open-source-project-on-github).

As this repository expands, more help is needed to write up documentation and translations. If you decide to contribute, please maintain formal grammar as defined in [Microsoft's Definitions of Formal Grammar](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365-life-hacks/writing/what-is-formal-writing-style-and-when-should-you-use-it).

For all contributions:
> * Please view issues and past pull requests to determine if your contribution is a duplicate of someone else's.
> * Please open a pull request and provide a through but succinct description on your changes and why it would be needed.
> * Please write your code with a clear, descriptive, but not overtly complicated style and follow proper indentation and formatting measures as defined in [Rust Nightly Style Guide](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nightly/style-guide/). If you are not sure how to format or are too lazy to do that, you can use `cargo fmt` to use the builtin formatting for cargo.

<h3>Small Contributions</h3>

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor as a patch, without a CLA.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

> * Spelling / grammar fixes
> * Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
> * Comment clean up
> * Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
> * Adding logging messages or debugging output
> * Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
> * Moving source files from one directory or package to another
